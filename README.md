# Classification Model using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate various classification models using machine learning techniques. The focus is on applying preprocessing steps, training multiple classifiers, and comparing their performance on a dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to classify data into predefined categories using supervised machine learning algorithms. The notebook walks through the entire pipeline of a classification task, from data loading and preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Essential Python libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

2. **Data Loading**  
   The dataset is loaded using `pandas`. *(You may need to specify the dataset if it's not uploaded.)*

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data structure, missing values, and distributions are explored.
   - Visualization using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

4. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values
   - Label encoding for categorical variables
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

5. **Train-Test Split**  
   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

6. **Model Building**  
   The following classifiers are trained:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Naive Bayes

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   Models are evaluated using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

8. **Comparison of Models**  
   A summary of model performances is presented to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## ✅ Results

Each model's performance is compared based on test accuracy and other metrics. The project helps identify which classifier works best for the given dataset after tuning and preprocessing.
